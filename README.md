[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/luin/express-di.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/luin/express-di)

Installation
-----
    npm install express-di

Compatibility
-----
    Express 3.x use express-di 3.x
    Express 4.x use express-di 5.x or 4.x

Usage
-----
To get started simply `require('express-di')` before `var app = express()`, and this module will monkey-patch Express, allowing you to define "dependencies" by providing the `app.factory()` method, after which you can use the "dependencies" in your routes following the [Dependency Injection pattern(DI)](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di).

Example
-----
In the past, if you want to pass variables between middlewares, you have to tack on properties to `req`, which seems odd and uncontrollable(that you couldn't point out easily which middleware add what properties to `req`). For example:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

var middleware1 = function(req, res, next) {
  req.people1 = { name: "Bob" };
  next();
};

var middleware2 = function(req, res, next) {
  req.people2 = { name: "Jeff" };
  next();
};

app.get('/', middleware1, middleware2, function(req, res) {
  res.json({
    people1: req.people1,
    people2: req.people2
  });
});

require('http').createServer(app).listen(3008);
```

After using express-di, you can do this:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
// Require express-di
require('express-di');
var app = express();

app.factory('people1', function(req, res, next) {
  next(null, { name: "Bob" });
});

app.factory('people2', function(req, res, next) {
  next(null, { name: "Jeff" });
});

app.get('/', function(people1, people2, res) {
  res.json({
    people1: people1,
    people2: people2
  });
});

require('http').createServer(app).listen(3008);

```

Define a dependency
-----
The `app.factory(name, fn)` method is used to define a dependency.

### Arguments

* `name`: The name of the dependency.
* `fn`: A function that is like a typical express middleware, takes 3 arguments, `req`, `res` and `next`, with a subtle difference that the `next` function takes 2 arguments: an error(can be null) and the value of the dependency.

### Default dependencies
express-di has defined three default dependencies: `req`, `res` and `next`, so that you can use these arguments in your router middlewares just as before.


Cache
-----
The same dependency will be cached per request. For instance:

```javascript
app.factory('me', function(req, res, next) {
  // This code block will only be executed once per request.
  User.find(req.params.userId, next);
});

var checkPermission = function(me, next) {
  if (!me) {
    return next(new Error('No permission.'));
  }
  next();
};

app.get('/me', checkPermission, function(me, res) {
  res.json(me);
});
```

Where can I use DI?
-----
You can use DI in your route-specific middlewares(aka `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`...).

Sub App
-----
Express-DI supports sub apps out of the box. Parent app cannot access the dependencies defined in the children apps, while children apps inherits the dependencies defined in the parent app:

    var express = require('express');
    require('express-di');
    var mainApp = express();
    var subApp = express();
    mainApp.use(subApp);

    mainApp.factory('parents', function(req, res, next) {
      next(null, 'parents');
    });

    subApp.factory('children', function(req, res, next) {
      next(null, 'children');
    });

    mainApp.get('/parents', function(children, res) {
      // throws error
      res.json(children);
    });

    subApp.get('/children', function(parents, res) {
      res.json(parents);
    });

Performance
-----
The process of DI will only be executed once at startup, so you don't need to worry about the performance.

You can test the performance using `make bench`.

Benchmark requires [`wrk`](https://github.com/wg/wrk) to be installed first. You can run `brew install wrk` for Mac OS, or [build it](https://github.com/wg/wrk/issues/39) from sources for Ubuntu.

Test
-----
* `make test`
* `make test-cov` will create the coverage.html showing the test-coverage of this module.
